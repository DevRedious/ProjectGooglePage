# Google Homepage Clone

My attempt at recreating Google's homepage with HTML and CSS.

## What is this?

I made a static version of Google's homepage for a web dev project. It's got the dark theme because I think it looks cooler than the white version.

## What's included

- Navigation bar at the top (Gmail, Images, apps button, sign in)
- The Google logo in the middle (I made it on Canva and exported as SVG so it stays sharp)
- Search bar with rounded corners
- Two buttons below the search
- Footer at the bottom with links
- Everything works on mobile too
- **Easter egg hidden somewhere on the page - try to find it!**

## Tech stuff

Just HTML and CSS, nothing fancy. No JavaScript because we haven't learned that yet.

I used Flexbox a lot to position things. Also added some hover effects to make it feel more interactive.

## Files

```
├── index.html          - Main HTML file
├── style.css           - All the styling
├── README.md           - This file
└── asset/
    ├── google-logo.svg - The Google logo ( made on Canva )
    ├── favicon.ico     - Browser tab icon
    └── icon_point.svg  - Apps menu icon ( made on Canva )
```

## How to run it

Just open the `index.html` file in your browser. That's it.

## Things I learned

- How to use Flexbox (finally understood it after struggling for a bit)
- Making things responsive with media queries
- Adding hover effects with CSS transitions
- Why SVG is better than PNG for logos
- How to center a div (googled it like 5 times lol)
- Found `transform: rotate` on https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/ and decided to add a little easter egg with it!

## Why it's not perfect

- The search bar doesn't actually search anything (no JS yet)
- Some spacing might be a bit off compared to real Google
- The apps button is just text, not the real icon grid
- Links don't go anywhere

But honestly for a first project I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.

## What I'd add later

- Make the search actually work with JavaScript
- Add the little microphone icon in the search bar
- Make the apps button show a real popup menu
- Better mobile version
